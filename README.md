# Advent of Code

This is my implementation of the puzzles found at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3 (`virtualenv` is recommended).

### Installing

The Python dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`, install them like this:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the puzzles

There is a CLI runner, which allows you to invoke the code to run a certain puzzle:

```
./run_puzzle.py --year 2017 --day 1
```

Or just run them all like this:

```
./run_puzzle.py --year 2017
```
